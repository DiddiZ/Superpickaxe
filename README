This plugin implements a simple super pickaxe that destroys everything with a single hit. It has fever features like WordEdit's super pickaxe, but is loggable with LogBLock and BigBrother. The default command to enable/diable the superpickaxe is "/spa" (Super PickAxe) but there is an option to override the WorldEdit commands "//" and "/,". Supports permissions, the only node is "superpickaxe.use".
